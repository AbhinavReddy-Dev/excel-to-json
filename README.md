# excel-to-json

Here we take an input in the form of excel (xls/ xlsx) and convert it to json on submission and display in the form of HTML element Table.

Although there are other middleware packages like express-fileupload, we work with multer here as its well documented and popular amongst the developers.
We reached a stage where the excel file is uploaded to the server and converted to json format. We even tried to use jQuery and Ajax to upload the JSON data into HTML table element dynamically but will take a bit more experimentation and learning to get the job done.
